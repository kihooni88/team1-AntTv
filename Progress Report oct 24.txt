   2. Update:
      1. Past week
        1. In the past week, I insert the photo slider on home page. 
2. I insert the latest ATV youtube video under the slider. It can be played on the home page. 
3. I added the social media links under the slider. Originally I planned to add  them on the header but the free version of the theme only allows me to add social media other than instagram. I tried to find other ways but they do not work under this theme. That’s why I insert it under the slider. 
4. I also insert a list type calendar at the end of the page so that students can quickly review what is happening recently. This calendar is synchronized with the calendar on Calendar page.
      1. Future week
        1. I will make changes due to your requirement if there is any.
